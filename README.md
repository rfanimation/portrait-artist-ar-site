## The Problem Every Artist Knows

You glance at your reference. Look at your canvas. Back to the reference. Back to the canvas. Is that eye too high? Is the shadow shape right? After hundreds of these micro-comparisons, your concentration is shattered and you're still not sure if your proportions are accurate.

## The Solution

Portrait Artist AR uses your iPhone's LiDAR sensor to project your reference image directly onto your physical canvas in augmented reality. No more guessing. No more endless back-and-forth. Just overlay, verify, and draw with confidence.

---

## How It Works

**1. Load Your Reference**
Select any image from your photo library — a photograph, master study, or your own sketch.

**2. Anchor to Your Canvas**
Point your camera at the marker near your canvas. Tap to lock the overlay in 3D space.

**3. Adjust & Align**
Scale, rotate, and position until your reference perfectly matches your canvas dimensions.

**4. Draw with Confidence**
Slide the opacity to check your work anytime. The overlay stays locked while you create.

## Features That Matter

### 🎯 Precision AR Tracking
LiDAR-powered positioning that stays locked to your canvas. No drift. No recalibration. Just stable, reliable overlay throughout your entire session.

### 👁️ Instant Value Checks
One tap converts your reference to 2-10 value levels. Finally see the underlying structure that makes great paintings work.

### ⚖️ Four Ways to Compare
- **Overlay** — Adjust opacity from 0-100%
- **Split** — Drag a divider across your view
- **Toggle** — Instant flip between reference and canvas
- **Difference** — See exactly where you've deviated

### 📐 Built-In Composition Guides
Rule of Thirds. Golden Ratio. Diagonals. The guides you need, when you need them.

### 💾 Pick Up Where You Left Off
Close the app mid-session? Your overlay position, scale, and settings are automatically saved and restored.

## What Artists Are Saying

> "I used to spend the first hour of every session just measuring. Now I verify in seconds and spend that time actually painting."

> "The value posterization alone is worth the price. I finally understand why my paintings were falling flat."

> "It's like having a master artist looking over your shoulder, but without the anxiety."
